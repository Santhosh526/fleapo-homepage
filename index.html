        <p>
          Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
          population with some countries and entities actively fighting against
          its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
          fort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
          launched all aiming to cure a problem or the air with some quite
          simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
          cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So far down
          that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their
          followers and then download an app, buy into the social currency of
          their favorite person and watch their investment as it with other
          crypto currency projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as
          countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that
          conventional social media platforms can offer.
